# vatsim-to-basestation
Converts the VATSIM network feed to a BaseStation feed

Defunct - there's too much ADSB stuff missing to go into a BaseStation feed, it
needs to be a VRS plugin instead. That way all of the things that you don't get
in BaseStation messages (like routes, VATSIM CIDs etc.) can be inserted into
the feed that VRS shows.
